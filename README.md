SOCIAL MEDIA

Good: it is good because it helps us in many ways like  texting each other,knowing about many new things
connecting with new people in group chats and updating ourselves with the latest news. we can also buy things from our home which will be delivered in minutes which makes our life more easier.

Bad: it is bad because many people are attracted and addicted to it spoiling their time . As these social media grew in the past few years more gen alpha kids are unable to concentrate in their academics  and we all cant live a day without it as it become a mandatory job to watch reels,shorts which is useless. 

Conclusion: social media is a platform where many people learn things and many get scammed by fake websites etc, so it is in our hands to use it wisely
